#### 2. Disclaimer file

At the root of every source code repository shall be the following text in a
file named `DISCLAIMER`:

This work was prepared as an account of work sponsored by an agency of the
United States Government. Neither the United States Government nor Lawrence
Livermore National Security, LLC, nor any of their employees makes any warranty,
expressed or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the
accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information, apparatus, product, or
